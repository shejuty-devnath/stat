LAD-Lasso Revisited

I recreated and extend the paper “Robust Regression Shrinkage and Consistent Variable Selection through the LAD-Lasso” by Hansheng Wang, Guodong Li, Guohua Jiang, as part of a 'High-dimensional data and statistical learning' course. The project highlights on implementing robust regression techniques and consistent variable selection using several penalized methods: SCAD, MCP, Lasso, Adaptive Lasso, and LAD-Lasso through understanding advanced algorithm.
