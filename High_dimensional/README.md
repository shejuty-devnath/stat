In this repository, I am showcasing my skills on the Theoretical framework of statistical methods for the analysis of large-scale data to understand data mining, and 
supervised and unsupervised statistical learning techniques from a statistical decision theoretic framework. Methods for model
selection, dimensionality reduction, multiple testing control, and estimation in high-dimension data. Emphasis on the conceptual 
underpinning of different tools for analysis of large-scale data and how they relate to each other. Applications in various fields, 
including the sciences and engineering, using computer software.
